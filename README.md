# Performing-EDA-on-Student-Scores

This repository contains a simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between the number of hours studied and the corresponding scores achieved. The project uses Python, the pandas library for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and matplotlib for data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is available in the following URL: [Dataset CSV](https://tinyurl.com/5n96xpkd). It contains two columns:
- `Hours`: The number of hours a student studied.
- `Scores`: The corresponding scores achieved by the student.

## Installation

Before running the code, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
